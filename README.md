# PayBack-Period

# Project Overview
- Our application is the payback period project. In the past few months, the peacekeepers have been planning and designing the web application for customers to use. 
- The payback period is a great tool for customers to use to determine the time it takes to recover the cost of an investment. 
- Our project was built using the ASP.Net framework.

# Challenges

In the past few months we have had to overcome many obstacles along the way to create our payback period. Some of these include:
- Creating databases to have user store information from each period
- Time management, completing tasks throughout the weeks
- Functionality: ensuring that the user can use the application correctly.
